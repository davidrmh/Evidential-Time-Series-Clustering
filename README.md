# Evidential Clustering of Time Series

* To do:
    * Interpret clusters in financial terms.
    * Look for other type of attributes e.g. returns.
    * Implement distances for time series data.
    * Do experiments with relational evidential clustering.
    * Create RNotebook with workflows.
    * Fit a classical HMM and do clustering with it.
    * Fit a Gaussian mixture and do clustering.
    * Implement Evidential Gaussian Mixture Model.
